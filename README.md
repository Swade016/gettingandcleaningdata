https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

**Running the script**
1. Create a folder, and download this script.
2. Download the archived dataset and extract to newly folder created in the previous step. The UCI HAR Dataset folder is extracted, and it has all the files in the required structure.
3. Run Rscript run_analysis.R
4. Two datasets should get created in the current directory as tidy_dataset.txt, and tidy_dataset_avgs.txt
5. Code book for the tidy dataset is available in the repo.
